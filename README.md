# Alien-Invasion

## Introduction
Alien Invasion is a classic arcade video game. In the game, players control a small spaceship at the bottom of the screen and must defend Earth from waves of descending alien invaders. The player's objective is to shoot down the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and to avoid getting hit by the aliens' counterattacks. As the game progresses, the aliens become faster and more numerous, making it increasingly challenging. It's known for its simple yet addictive gameplay and iconic pixelated alien designs.
